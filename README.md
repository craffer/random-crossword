# Random NYT Crossword

This repo randomly generates links to a crossword puzzle from [the New York Times archive](https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords/archive).

## Usage

Run the generator by running:

```sh
python3 randcw/main.py
```

This is just a proof-of-concept for now â€“ eventually a UI component will be added.
